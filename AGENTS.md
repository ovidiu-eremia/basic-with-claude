# AGENTS.md

This repository's detailed guidance for contributors and AI agents lives in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
Read and follow that file before making changes. It covers the development philosophy, TDD workflow,
milestone structure, definition of done, testing strategy, and other guidelines that all contributors must obey.

## Testing

Run all tests before committing:

```bash
go test ./...
```
